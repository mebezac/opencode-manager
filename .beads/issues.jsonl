{"id":"opencode-manager-d5b","title":"Add plugin field support to OpenCodeConfigSchema","description":"When users add \"plugin\": [\"opencode-beads\"] to their OpenCode config, it gets stripped on restart because the field is not defined in the schema.\n\nRoot Cause: The OpenCodeConfigSchema in /workspace/repos/opencode-manager/shared/src/schemas/settings.ts doesn't include the plugin field, so Zod's .parse() strips unknown fields.\n\nFix Needed: Add plugin: z.array(z.string()).optional() to the OpenCodeConfigSchema.\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n1. The plugin field should be added to OpenCodeConfigSchema in shared/src/schemas/settings.ts\n2. The field should be optional array of strings: plugin: z.array(z.string()).optional()\n3. When users add plugin config, it should persist after restart\n4.
