{"id":"opencode-manager-m5l","title":"Fix multi-token git authentication causing Duplicate header: Authorization errors","description":"When multiple GitHub PATs are configured in OpenCode Manager settings, the backend sets GIT_CONFIG_KEY_* and GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_* environment variables globally. These add Authorization headers for all git operations to github.com. When multiple credentials exist, multiple headers are added, causing the 'Duplicate header: Authorization' error.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nIn backend/src/services/opencode-single-server.ts at line 117, createGitEnv() creates env vars with multiple Authorization headers, then at line 130-131 these are spread into the spawned OpenCode server's environment. However, these env vars are leaking into the parent shell environment.\n\n**Files to examine:**\n- backend/src/services/opencode-single-server.ts (lines 117-138)\n- backend/src/utils/git-auth.ts (lines 41-69, specifically createGitEnv)\n\n**Potential fixes:**\n1. Don't use GIT_CONFIG_KEY_* approach - instead use a different method like .gitconfig or credential helper\n2. Only set these env vars for specific git operations, not globally\n3. Create a wrapper that isolates the env vars\n4. Document the workaround for users\n\n**Acceptance criteria:**\n1. Users can run git push, git pull, etc. from command line without Duplicate header errors\n2. The OpenCode server still works correctly with multiple credentials\n3. Per-repo credential selection continues to work\n4.
